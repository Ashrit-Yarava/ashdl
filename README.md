> Another spotify playlist downloader.

A straightforward application that downloads a spotify playlist into the current directory.

## External Dependencies:

1. YT-DLP/Youtube-DL
2. FFMPEG
3. Spotify API Access

Youtube DL path needs to be specified. (Prevent PATH conflicts.)

## Notes/Warnings

* Haven't gotten the chance to test the application on a private playlist so idk what'll happen there.
